GameProgressSign is a TShock plugin for Terraria that provides a simple yet powerful feature: it automatically displays the boss progression status on two signs at the spawn location of your server world. This allows players to quickly see which bosses have been defeated without checking the game menus.

ðŸŒŸ Features:
âœ… Automatic Boss Tracking: The plugin tracks the defeat of pre-Hardmode and Hardmode bosses.

âœ… Real-Time Updates: The signs are updated immediately after a boss is defeated or manually using the /bossstatus command.

âœ… Non-Destructive Updates: The plugin preserves existing signs, updating their text instead of replacing them.

âœ… Efficient and Optimized: Only updates the signs if they already exist, avoiding unnecessary sign replacement or obstacle clearing.

âœ… Configurable Support: Can be easily extended to customize boss lists or sign placement.

ðŸš€ Commands:
/bossstatus - Manually update the boss status signs.

ðŸ“Œ Installation:
Download the plugin DLL and place it in your TShock serverâ€™s Plugins folder.

Restart your TShock server.

The plugin will automatically generate and update the boss status signs at the spawn location.
